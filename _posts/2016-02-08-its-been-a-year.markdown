**It's been a year** since I created this superuseful, adorable blog.
I benefit from it all the time. First of all, I want to say "Thank You" to all my readers (including my dog and fridge, WTF).

Secondly, Ima set myself some challenges for the next year:
* more posts, at least 3
* more money
* SWAG

I think that's all for now, ttyl.
